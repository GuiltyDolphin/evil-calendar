;;; Commentary:

;; evil-calendar provides integration between Evil and Emacs'
;; calendar mode.
;;
;; Integration includes keybindings, which aim to be as
;; conceptually close to Evil's existing bindings as possible,
;; whilst retaining convenience.
;;
;; For more information see the README.

;;; Code:

(require 'dash)
(require 'evil)

(define-minor-mode evil-calendar-mode
  "Minor-mode for evil calendar integration.

Active when in Emacs' `calendar-mode'."
  :keymap (make-sparse-keymap))

(add-hook 'calendar-mode-hook 'evil-calendar-mode)

;;;; Movement
